	       	Some of our favorite moments from the time we shared with the graduating class of 2014 are Columbia College Chicago’s musical procession, the way the University of Wisconsin-Madison ‘jumps around,’ how strawberries and champagne are served up at Vanderbilt, bagpipes at Webster, Emory’s candlelight bridge crossing, Colgate University’s torchlight ceremony, and cannons of confetti at the University of Albany.
