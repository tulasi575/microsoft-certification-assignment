	     		Roses are red, Violets are…I guess I should leave the love poems to the experts. And there are so many experts to choose from. Since there's been poetry, there's been love poems. Whether it's the love of friendship described between Gilgamesh and Enkidu or the romantic love Homer describes between Penelope and Odysseus or Paris and…himself, poets have been writing about love for a long time. Since the days of epic poetry, poets have used sonnets, free verse, villanelles, slam poetry, short poems, and even instagram poetry to describe love. These love poems I've collected vary widely. Some are classic love poems. Some love poems were posted on social media this year.  Some rhyme. Others don't. Most are romantic. A few are sad or angry. All of them are beautiful. All of them are about love.
